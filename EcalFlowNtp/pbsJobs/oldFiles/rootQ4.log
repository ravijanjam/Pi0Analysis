 Using the pi0 mass window for the observed v2 region

 The use of the pi0 efficiency table was not requested

 The use of the track efficiency table was requested

 Found the charged particle efficiency table ROOT file

 Minimum Bias data sets are used


 Found hTree in input file first.root
 The tree contains 1439285 entries
 The tree will be processed for 1439285 entries


 using fourth pair of pT bins

 Being hTree scan for iOption = 33 with first entry number 0, mixed-event background method will be used
