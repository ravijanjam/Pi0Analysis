 Using the pi0 mass window for the observed v2 region


 Conversion checking requested, truth information from simTracks

 Only same parent clusters will be combined for reco

 The use of the pi0 efficiency table was not requested

 The use of the charged particle efficiency table was not requested

 Minimum Bias data sets are used
