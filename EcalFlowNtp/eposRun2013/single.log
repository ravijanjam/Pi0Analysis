 Cuts used for pair correlations:
 Trigger (pi0) particle from 0.3 to 8 GeV/c
 Associated charged particle from 0.3 to 3 GeV/c

 The low invariant mass cut is 0.095 GeV/c^2
 The high invariant mass cut is 0.175 GeV/c^2

 The cluster S4/S9 cut is 0.74
The pT bin width used are: 16	1.6	12
pT bins used for the histogram: 10	0.7	8

 Using a pT dependent separation cut parameterization 35.657/pT - 4.1995/pT^2,  with a rescale factor 0.7

 The goodAngleMatch opening angle criterion for reco track-cluster matching is 0.029 radians

 The goodPhiMatch residual angle criterion for reco track-cluster matching is 0.029 radians

 The goodThetaMatch residual angle criterion for reco track-cluster matching is 0.029 radians

 Cluster energy value will be recalibrated according to number of crystals in the cluster

 There is no check on the number of crystals in a cluster

 Cluster with a charged particle tracking match will not be used

 An output tree will be generated according to the xxxStore parameters
